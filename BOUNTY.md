## Notes

- Thirdweb Pay onramp is installed; however, they do not have it deployed to Avalanche Fuji yet.
- Desktop UI functionality for the frontend app is very good.
- Mobile UI support within wallet apps is great on MetaMask, needs some work on Core.
- Mobile UI support for MetaMask/Core via Safari/Chrome is good.
- PWA functionality is installed, however more testing is needed to ensure it works as expected.

## Disclaimer

The frontend app is not fully ready for public/social media testing/scrutiny yet, however feel free to share with anyone you wish.
